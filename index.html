	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">here</a>. I made this version using P5.js. Click
  squares on the box to turn them on and click enter to run it or pause it. You can change the state of squres while
  the game runs. Enjoy. A better version of the game is <a href="https://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/"> here.</a></li>
